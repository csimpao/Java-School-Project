Everything does work, and everything has the same output just like in the log. Thank you!

If 'delsong' doesn't work when you delete a song from songs list and playlist, you need to go type in songs so that you can see the song number of that song, and type in that exact song number from songs list, which is what you exactly did in the log. Thank you!

For 'addtopl' I made an error message which puts all error messages into one line, just in case if you put any possible invalid input, even though there was no test case about that in the log. Also, in that same action, don't put the type PODCAST, since I didn't do the bonus. Thank you!

For searchP I don't know if I had to put an exceptions, but when you type in an invalid target string, it'll print nothing. That means that it still works, since it didn't print the content with that invalid target string. Thank you!

Just in case, you can still refer to the a1 comments. Thank you!

Also for the Shogun book, I made up 4 chapter titles in the file, just to be more clear for that book when you do bookTOC method. Thank you!


Also I made separate files for the exception classes, because when I put them outside in the same file of Library class and compiled in terminal, it didn't work, but when I put them as separate, and compiled it, it does work. I don't know if that's what it means to put the exception classes outside the Library class. Thank you!!
